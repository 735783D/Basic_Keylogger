This is a walkthrough for a genuine keylogger that can only be used 
after you create an exception in your AV or OS for the file
that you use. If you do not make an exception, it will be flagged, 
quarantined, and deleted from your system. 

I have tested this and it does work. It is only 12 lines of code
that can be built upon to possibly bypass AV by being loaded 
into memory to run a script that will add an exception to the AV
scanner on the target OS. This would make it very stealthy. The
only problem would come when you wanted to retrieve the log...

This is a tutorial from the video [Basic Keylogger with Python | Easy Cyber security Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuH_9OGrVt4).
It is a short, sweet, and easy to follow video.

This does require the `pynput` library to be installed on your system.
